# Training

# Using Module

1. First clone the repository
```
	git clone https://github.com/libindic/sandhi-splitter.git
```
2. Create a installable source and then install using pip
```
	python setup.py sdist
	pip install dist/sandhisplitter*.tar.gz
```

Note: We suggest you work on virtualenv instead of installing
system-wide using `sudo`, since module is still under development.
